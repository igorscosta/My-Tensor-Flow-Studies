--------------- Meta-architectures-----------------


-> Faster R-CNN (Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network)
    - Detection happens in two stages
    - 1st Region Proposal Network
    - 

-> R-FCN (Region-based Fully Convolutional Networks)
    

-> SSD (Single Shot Detector)
   - Uses a single feed-forward convolutional network to directly predict classes and anchor offsets
   without requiring a second stage per-proposal classification operation.




------------- Feature Extractors ------------------

-> VGG - 16

-> Resnet-101

-> Inception v2

-> Inception v3

-> Inception Resnet (v2)

-> MobileNet
